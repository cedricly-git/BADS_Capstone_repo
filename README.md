# BADS_Capstone_repo
This is the repository for our Business Analytics and Data Science Captsone Project.

Our goal is to create an application using python code and streamlit to solve an business problem. This application is related to our BADS course and is part of our examination.

The application is going to show the correlation between weather and food delivery, so that we can give recommandations to food delivery companies and restaurant on how to manage their workers and stocks.
